## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are the basics of programming and candidates are extensively evaluated on the basis of it in most of the coding interviews. It is important for us to be in touch with DSA and keep practicing. This repository is a small effort by us to help others in addition to improve ourselves. It contains the most important coding questions from most of the topics and is being maintained actively.

**Who can be benefited from it?**
